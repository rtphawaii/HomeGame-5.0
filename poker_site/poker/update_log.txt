#UPDATES AND FIXES NEEDED:

#UPDATE 1
#must fix all-in scenarios where one player is out of balance

# PROGRESS 3 -> needs testing, partially works
# PROGRESS 3 -> breaks when a short stacked player goes all-in and the bigger stack player subsequently goes all-in
# BACKUP -> Google Drive HomeGame 5.3 

#UPDATE 13G - Done
# fix raise loop where raiser gets action again

#UPDATE 13H - Done
# fix add balance glitch where when one player adds balance another cannot afterward. Everything seems to be working.

#UPDATE 13J - Done
# fix desktop all-in button and mobile layout

#UPDATE 14 - Done
# all-in big stack over short stack broken again

#UPDATE 15 - Done
# big stack goes all-in and short stack can continue betting portions of stack instead of going all-in
# PROGRESS: The big stack does have a cap when they go all-in now but other things broke. now when the big stack goes all-in and short stack is forced to go all-in no matter what they send, they cant fold either. Even if the short stack bets 5 it goes to an all-in. instead it should be an error message or something and require them to either enter the amount of their whole stack or use the all-in button. When someone goes all-in and it is two players, it automatically makes the other person go all-in as well.
# all all-in scenarios seem to work

#UPDATE 16 - Need
# When players bust it is still possible to start another round and they are included in the round
# right now they need to either buy back in before start new round or the game will break
# so if someone busts they need to buy back in or a new room needs to be created and game start from scratch

#UPDATE 17 - Done
# cleaned up code a little, removed functions that arent being used or commented out like bets() and evaluate_original()

#UPDATE 18 - Done
# add start new round button, add player box with betting order, indicator, and balance
